    <h2>A 'BUS 'OSS'S MEMS.</h2>

    <h4>(<i>Kept during a recent Social Crisis.</i>)</h4>

    <p><i>Saturday, June 6</i>, 11 P.M.&mdash;Home after our last
    turn. Fancy from several drinks had on the way, and the pace we
    had to put into that last mile and a half, that something's up.
    Turned into stall nice and comfortable, as usual.</p>

    <p><i>Sunday.</i>&mdash;Something is up with a vengeance.
    Hoorooh! We're on strike. I don't know the rights of it, nor
    don't care, as long as I have my bit of straw to roll in, and a
    good feed twice a day. I wonder, by the way, if the fellow who
    looks after my oats is "off." Past feeding time. Feel uneasy
    about it. Hang it all, I would rather work for <i>my</i>
    living, than be tied up here doing nothing without a feed! Ha!
    here he is, thank goodness, at last. However, better late than
    never. Capital fun this strike.</p>

    <p><i>Monday.</i>&mdash;Am sent out in a loyal omnibus. Hooted
    at and frightened with brickbats. Felt half inclined to shy.
    Halloa! what's this? Hit on the ribs with a paving-stone. Come,
    I won't stand this. Kick and back the 'bus on to the pavement.
    All the windows smashed by Company's men. Passengers get out.
    Somebody cuts the traces, and I allow myself to be led back to
    the stables. Don't care about this sort of fun. However, feed
    all right.</p>

    <p><i>Tuesday.</i>&mdash;Hear that the men want thirteen and
    sixpence a day and a seven hours' turn. Directors offer five
    and sixpence, and make the minimum seventeen hours. Go it, my
    hearties! Fight away! Who cares? You must feed <i>me</i>,
    that's quite certain. Still I don't care about being cooped up
    here all day. Nasty feeling of puffiness about the knees. Hang
    the strike!</p>

    <p><i>Wednesday.</i>&mdash;Puffiness worse. Vet. looks in and
    says I want exercise. Take a bolus and am walked for half an
    hour or so up and down some back-streets. Bless
    them!&mdash;that ain't no good.</p>

    <p><i>Thursday.</i>&mdash;Puffiness worse, of course. Bother it
    all, being shut up here! What wouldn't I give just for a sight
    of dear old Piccadilly! The fact is, if they don't soon let me
    have my run from King's Cross to Putney, I shall "bust
    up"&mdash;and that's a fact. I feel it.</p>

    <p><i>Friday.</i>&mdash;Ah, they may well come to terms!
    Another day of this, and I believe I should have been off the
    hooks "for ever and for aye." It's all very well for Capital
    and Labour to get at loggerheads, but, as DUCROW said, they
    must cut all their disputes short if they wish to save anything
    of their business, and look sharp, and "come to the
    'osses."</p>

    <p><i>Saturday, 13th</i>.&mdash;Strike over! We shall have to
    be in harness again on Monday, and not a day too soon, in the
    interests of the men, the Directors, the Public; and, last, but
    by no means least, specially that of "the 'osses."</p>

    <h2>LEAVES FROM A CANDIDATE'S DIARY.</h2>

    <p><i>Billsbury, Wednesday, May 28th</i>.&mdash;Great doings
    here to-day. For weeks past all the Conservative Ladies of
    Billsbury have been hard at work, knitting, sewing, painting,
    embroidering, patching, quilting, crocheting, and Heaven knows
    what besides, for the Bazaar in aid of the Conservative Young
    Men's Club and Coffee-Room Sustentation Fund. You couldn't call
    at any house in Billsbury without being nearly smothered in
    heaps of fancy-work of every kind. When I was at the PENFOLDS'
    on Monday afternoon, the drawing-room was simply littered with
    bonnets and hats, none of them much larger than a crown piece,
    which Miss PENFOLD had been constructing. She tried several of
    them on, in order to get my opinion as to their merits. She
    looked very pretty in one of them, a cunning arrangement of
    forget-me-nots and tiny scraps of pink ribbon. Mother promised
    some time ago to open the Bazaar, though she assured me she had
    never done such a thing before, and added that I must be sure
    to see that the doors moved easily, as new doors were so apt to
    stick, and she didn't know what she should do if she had to
    struggle over the opening. I comforted her by telling her she
    would only have to say a few brief words on a platform,
    declaring the Bazaar open. For the last week I have had a
    letter from her by absolutely every post, sending draft
    speeches for my approval. After much consideration I selected
    one of these, which I returned to her. I heard from home that
    she was very busily occupied for some time in learning it by
    heart. When cook came for orders in the morning, she was forced
    to listen while Mother said over the speech to her. Cook was
    good enough to express a high opinion of its beauties.</p>

    <p>Yesterday evening Mother arrived, with the usual enormous
    amount of luggage, including the inevitable <i>Carlo</i>. After
    dinner I heard her repeat the speech, which went off very well.
    This is it:&mdash;"Ladies and Gentlemen, I am so pleased to be
    here to-day, and to have the opportunity of helping the dear
    Conservative cause in Billsbury. I am sure you are all so
    anxious to buy as many of these lovely things as you can, and I
    therefore lose no time in declaring the Bazaar open." Simple,
    but efficient.</p>

    <p>The opening to-day was fixed for 2:30, the Bazaar being held
    in the large room of the Assembly Rooms, which had been
    arranged to represent an Old English Village. At one o'clock
    Colonel and Mrs. CHORKLE, Alderman and Mrs. TOLLAND, and one or
    two others, lunched with us, and afterwards we all drove off
    together in a procession of carriages. I insisted on
    <i>Carlo</i> being left behind, locked up in Mother's bed-room,
    with a dish of bones to comfort him, and an old dress of
    Mother's to lie on. That old dress has been devoted to
    <i>Carlo</i> for the last two years, and no amount of
    persuasion will induce <i>Carlo</i> to take another instead. We
    tried him with a much better one a short time ago, but he was
    furious, tore it to ribbons and refused his food until his old
    disreputable dress had been restored to him.</p>

    <p>The Bazaar proceedings began with a short prayer delivered
    by the Bishop of BRITISH GUIANA, an old Billsbury
    Grammar-School boy, who was appointed to the bishopric a month
    ago. Everybody is making a tremendous fuss about him here of
    course. As soon as the prayer was over, Colonel CHORKLE rose
    and made what he would call one of his "'appiest hefforts." The
    influence of lovely woman, Conservative principles, devotion to
    the Throne, the interests of the Conservative Young Men's
    Sustentation Fund, all mixed up together like a hasty pudding.
    Then came the moment for Mother. First, however, WILLIAMINA
    HENRIETTA SMITH CHORKLE had to be removed outside for causing a
    disturbance. Her father's speech so deeply affected this
    intelligent infant, who had come under the protection of her
    nurse, that she burst out into a loud yell and refused to be
    comforted. The Colonel's face was a study&mdash;a mixture of
    drum-head Courts-martial and Gatling guns. Mother got through
    with her little speech all right. As a matter of fact she read
    it straight off a sheet of paper, having finally decided that
    her memory was too treacherous. We both set to work and bought
    an incredible amount of things. After half an hour I found
    myself in possession of six bonnets made by Miss PENFOLD, three
    knitted waistcoats, four hand-painted screens, two tea-tables
    also hand-painted, a lady's work-basket, three fancy shawls, a
    set of glass studs and a double perambulator, which I won in a
    raffle. Mother got three dog-collars, a set of shaving
    materials (won in a raffle), two writing cases, five fans, two
    pictures by a local artist, four paper-knives, two carved
    cigar-boxes, a set of tea things, and five worked
    table-covers.</p>

    <p>When we got back, we found that <i>Carlo</i> had nearly
    gnawed his way through the bed-room door, and was growling
    horribly at the boots and the chambermaid through the keyhole.
    Charming dog!</p>

            linen is "swell" and sweet,</p>

            <p>But steaming reek is around our heads, and trickling

    <h3>STRIKING INTELLIGENCE.&mdash;A Page from a Londoner's
    Diary.</h3>

    <p><i>Sunday</i>.&mdash;Can scarcely believe the news! What, no
    omnibuses! A strike! What <i>shall</i> we do? Fortunately
    always go to church on foot, so no loss in that. Then
    subsequent parade in the Park&mdash;don't require an omnibus
    for that, either. At the end of the day, can say that, take one
    thing with another, state of affairs more comfortable than
    might have been anticipated.</p>

    <p><i>Monday</i>.&mdash;Dreaded continuance of strike, but
    found, practically, little inconvenience. Had to walk to the
    office, and enjoyed the promenade immensely. Had no idea that a
    stroll along the Embankment was so delightful. After all, one
    can exist without omnibuses&mdash;at least, for a time.</p>

    <p><i>Tuesday</i>.&mdash;Find that people who were at their
    wits' end at the mere suggestion of a strike, are becoming
    reconciled to the situation. Streets certainly pleasanter
    without the omnibuses. Great, lumbering conveyances, filling up
    the road, and stopping the traffic! London looks twice as well
    without them! Tradesmen, too, say that the shops are just as
    well attended now as when the two great Companies were in full
    swing.</p>

    <p><i>Wednesday</i>.&mdash;Can't see what the omnibus people
    (both sides&mdash;Directors and <i>employés</i>) are
    quarrelling about. No matter of mine, and the Public are only
    too glad for a chance of a good walk. Fifty per cent. better
    since I have been obliged to give up the morning 'bus. Asked
    to-day to contribute something in support of the strikers.
    Certainly not, the longer the strike lasts the worse for the
    Public.</p>

    <p><i>Thursday</i>.&mdash;Really the present state of affairs
    is delightful. I have to thank the deadlock for teaching me to
    patronise the river steamboats. Pleasant journey from Vauxhall
    to the Temple for a penny! No idea that the Thames was so
    pretty at Westminster. View of the Houses of Parliament and the
    Embankment capital.</p>

    <p><i>Friday</i>.&mdash;Strike continues. Well I do not
    complain. Hired a hansom and find that considering the cab
    takes you up to door, it is really cheaper in the long run. If
    you use an omnibus, you get jolted, and run a chance of
    smashing your hat. If it rains you get splashed and having to
    finish your journey on foot, you might just as well have walked
    the whole way.</p>

    <p><i>Saturday</i>.&mdash;Strike arranged to cease on Monday!
    This is too much! Just as we were getting comfortable, all the
    disgusting lumbering old omnibuses are to come back again! It
    ought not to be allowed. Asked to-day to contribute something
    in support of the strikers. Certainly, the longer the strike
    lasts the better for the Public.</p>

    <h3>EXPLANATIONS À LA MODE.</h3>

    <h4>(<i>A Prophetic Forecast, by a Professional
    Pessimist.</i>)</h4>

    <p>1891. The Leader of the House explains, in answer to a
    question, that no understanding exists between England and any
    Foreign country. No treaty is in contemplation, and never has
    been suggested on either side.</p>

    <p>1892. The Government repeats that England is absolutely free
    from any international engagements. It must not be thought for
    a moment that a single battalion will be moved, or a solitary
    vessel dispatched abroad with warlike intentions.</p>

    <p>1893. The Representative of the Cabinet once more denies the
    suggestion that, under any consideration whatever, will England
    bind herself to accept European responsibility. This has been
    said constantly for the last three years, and the
    Representative of the Cabinet is not only surprised but pained
    at these frequent and embarrassing interrogations.</p>

    <p>1894. Once more, and for the last time, the PREMIER insists
    that whatever may happen abroad, England will be free from
    interference. It has been the policy of this great country for
    the last four years to steer clear of all embarrassing
    international complications. The other Great Powers are
    perfectly aware that, under no circumstances whatever, will our
    Army and Fleet be employed in taking part in the quarrels of
    our neighbours. The entire Cabinet are grieved at questions so
    frequently put to them&mdash;questions that are not only
    disquieting abroad, but a slur upon the intentions of men whose
    sole duty is the safety and peace of the British Empire.</p>

    it!</p>

    <h4>A SKETCH AT THE ROYAL NAVAL EXHIBITION.</h4>

    <blockquote>
        <p>SCENE&mdash;<i>The Grounds. A string of Sightseers
        discovered passing slowly in front of a row of glazed cases
        containing small mechanical figures, which are set in
        motion in the usual manner.</i></p>
    </blockquote>

    <h4>BEFORE A SCENE REPRESENTING A DYING CHILD.</h4>

    <p><i>A Gallant Swain</i>. That's the kid in bed, yer see. Like
    to see it die, POLLY, eh? A penny does it.</p>

    <p><i>Polly</i> (<i>with a giggle</i>). Well, if it ain't
    <i>too</i> 'arrowing. (<i>The penny is dropped in, and the
    mechanical mother is instantly agitated by the deepest maternal
    anxiety.</i>) That's the mother kneeling by the bed, I
    suppose&mdash;she do pray natural. There's the child waking
    up&mdash;see, it's moving its 'ed. (<i>The little doll raises
    itself in bed, and then falls back lifeless.</i>) Ah, it's
    gone&mdash;look at the poor mother 'idin' her face.</p>

    <p><i>The G.S.</i> Well, it's all over. Come along and see
    something more cheerful.</p>

    <p><i>Polly</i>. Wait a bit&mdash;it isn't 'alf over yet.
    There's a angel got to come and carry her away
    fust&mdash;there, the door's opening, that'll be the angel come
    for it, I expect. (<i>Disappointed.</i>) No, it's only the
    doctor. (<i>A jerky and obviously incompetent little medical
    practitioner puts his head in at the door, and on being
    motioned back by the bereaved mother, retires with more
    delicacy than might have been expected.</i>) Well, he might ha'
    seen for himself if the child <i>was</i> dead! (<i>The back of
    the bed disappears, disclosing a well-known picture of an angel
    flying upwards with a child.</i>) I did think they'd have a
    real angel, and not only a picture of one, and anyone can see
    it's a different child&mdash;there's the child in bed just the
    same. I call that a take-in!</p>

    <p><i>The G.S.</i> I dunno what more you expect for a
    penny.</p>

    <p><i>A Person on the Outskirts</i> (<i>eagerly to Friend</i>).
    What happened? What is it? I couldn't make it out over all the
    people's shoulders.</p>

    <p><i>His Friend</i>. Dying child&mdash;not half bad either.
    You go and put in a penny, and you'll see it well enough.</p>

    <p><i>The P. on the O.</i> (<i>indignantly</i>). What, put in a
    penny for such rubbish? Not me!</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>[<i>He hangs about till someone else provides the
        necessary coin.</i></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><i>A Softhearted Female</i>. No, I couldn't stand there and
    look on. I never <i>can</i> bear them pathetic subjects. I felt
    just the same with that picture of the Sick Child at the
    Academy, you know. (<i>Meditatively.</i>) And you don't have to
    put a penny in for <i>that</i>, either.</p>

    <h4>BEFORE ANOTHER BEDROOM SCENE REPRESENTING "THE DRUNKARD'S
    DELIRIUM."</h4>

    <p><i>First Woman</i>. That's 'im in bed, with the bottle in
    his 'and. He likes to take his liquor comfortable, <i>he</i>
    do.</p>

    <p><i>Second Woman</i>. He's very neat and tidy, considering
    ain't he? I wonder what his delirium is like. 'Ere, ROSY, come
    and put your penny in as the gentleman give yer. (ROSY, <i>aged
    six, sacrifices her penny, under protest.</i>) Now, you
    look&mdash;you can't think what pretty things you'll see.</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>[<i>The little wooden drunkard sits up, applies the
        bottle to his mouth, and sinks back contentedly; a demon,
        painted a pleasing blue, rises slowly by his bed-side: the
        drunkard takes a languid interest in him; the demon
        sinks.</i></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><i>A Gentleman with a bloated complexion</i>
    (<i>critically</i>). 'Ooever did that&mdash;well, I dessay he's
    a very clever man, but&mdash;(<i>compassionately</i>)&mdash;he
    don't know much about 'orrors, <i>he</i> don't!</p>

    <p><i>A Facetious Friend. You</i> could ha' told him a thing or
    two, eh, JIM?</p>

    <p><i>The Bloated Gentleman</i> (<i>contemptuously</i>). Well,
    if I never 'ad them wuss than <i>that</i>!</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>[<i>A small skeleton, in a shroud, looks in at the
        door.</i></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><i>The F.F.</i> 'Ullo, 'ere's the King o' Terrors for yer!
    (ROSY <i>shows signs of uneasiness; a blue demon comes out of a
    cupboard.</i>) 'Ere's another of 'em&mdash;quite a little party
    he's 'aving!</p>

    <p><i>A Gentleman, in a white tie</i> (<i>as the machinery
    stops</i>). Well, a thing like this does more real good than
    many a temperance tract.</p>

    <p><i>The Bloated G.</i> Yer right there, Guv'nor&mdash;it's
    bin a lesson to <i>me</i>, I know that. 'Ere, will you come and
    'ave a whiskey-sour along of me and my friend 'ere'?</p>

    <h4>BEFORE A MODEL REPRESENTING AN EXECUTION.</h4>

    <p><i>A Daughter</i>. But <i>why</i> won't you 'put a penny
    into this one, Father?</p>

    <p><i>The Father</i> (<i>firmly</i>). Because I don't approve
    of Capital Punishment, my dear.</p>

    <p><i>A Cultivated Person</i>. An execution&mdash;"put a penny
    in; bell tolls&mdash;gates open&mdash;scaffold shown with
    gallows. Executioner pulls bolt&mdash;black flag"&mdash;dear,
    dear&mdash;most degrading, shocking taste! (<i>To his
    Friend.</i>) Oh, of course, I'll wait, if you want to see
    it&mdash;not got a <span class="pagenum"><a name="page293"
       id="page293"></a>[pg 293]</span> penny? Let me
       see&mdash;yes, <i>I</i> can lend you one. (<i>He does; the
       penny is put in&mdash;nothing happens.</i>) Out of order, I
       suppose&mdash;scandalous! and nobody to speak to about
       it&mdash;<i>most</i> discreditable! Stop&mdash;what's this?
       (<i>A sort of woolly beat is audible inside the prison;
       the</i> C.P. <i>beams.</i>) That's the bell
       tolling&mdash;it's all right, it's working! [<i>It
       works.</i></p>

    <p><i>Another Spectator</i>. Very well done, that was&mdash;but
    they 'urried it over a little too quick. I scarcely saw the man
    'ung at all!</p>

    <p><i>His Companion</i>. Put in another penny, and p'raps
    you'll see him cut down, old chap.</p>

    <p><i>Susan Jane</i> (<i>to her Soldier</i>.) Oh, ain't that
    pretty? I should like to know what <i>my</i> fortune is.
    [<i>She feels in her pocket.</i></p>

    <p><i>The Soldier</i> (<i>who disapproves of useless
    expenditure</i>). Ain't you put in enough bloomin' pennies?</p>

    <p><i>Susan Jane</i>. This is the last. (<i>Reads
    Directions</i>.) Oh, you've got to set the finger on the dial
    to the question you want answered, and then put your penny in.
    What shall I ask her?</p>

    <p><i>Soldier</i>. Anyone would think you meant to go by the
    answer, to hear you talk!</p>

    <p><i>Susan Jane</i>. P'raps I do. (<i>Coquettishly, as she
    sets the index to a printed question.</i>) Now, you mustn't

    <p>The most interesting book, one of the Baron's Retainers
    ("blythe and gay,") has read this year is, <i>The Life of
    Laurence Oliphant</i>. If it were not written by a reputable
    person, and published by so eminently respectable a house as
    BLACKWOOD's, there would be difficulty about accepting it as a
    true story of the life of a man whom some of us knew, as lately
    living in London, wearing a frock coat, and even a tall hat of
    cylindrical shape. Such a mingling of shrewd business qualities
    and March madness as met in LAURENCE OLIPHANT is surely a new
    thing. A man of gentle birth, of high culture, of wide
    experience, of supreme ability, and, strangest of all, with a
    keen sense of humour&mdash;that such an one should voluntarily
    step down from high social position at the bidding of a vulgar,
    selfish, self-seeking, and, according to some hints dropped
    here and there, grossly immoral man, should, at beck of his fat
    forefinger, go forth to a strange land to live amid sordid
    circumstances, and with uncongenial company, to work as a
    common, farm-labourer, to peddle strawberries at a railway
    station, passes belief. With respect to Mr. HARRIS, one feels
    inclined to quote <i>Betsy Prig's</i> remark touching one who
    may, peradventure, have been a maternal relation. "I don't

    there was, and, stranger still, there was a LAURENCE OLIPHANT
    to bend the knee to him. Not the least striking thing in a book
    of rare value is the manner in which Mrs. OLIPHANT has
    acquitted herself in a peculiarly difficult task. No man would
    have had the restraining patience necessary to deal with the
    HARRIS episodes as she has done.</p>

    <p>The Assistant Reader has been refreshing himself with
    <i>Lapsus Calami</i>, by J.K.S., published by MACMILLAN and
    BOWES. It is a booklet of light verse, containing here and
    there some remarkably brilliant pieces of satire and parody.
    The first of two parodies of ROBERT BROWNING is unsurpassable
    for successful audacity. The last poem in the book is "An
    Election Address," written for, but apparently not used by, the
    present POSTMASTER-GENERAL, when he was Candidate for Cambridge
    University, in 1882. He says of himself, after confessing to a
    dislike for literature and science,&mdash;</p>

    <p>Will you, if you please, point out to me the way to the
    streets which, I am told, are paved with gold?</p>

    <p>Where shall I find the employer of labour who, I have been
    told, will instantly get me occupation at a wage of 60 roubles
    the week?</p>

    <p>Dear me! in this, then, your "White Chapel"? I was told it
    was a luxurious quarter, famous for its Palaces.</p>

    <p>Surely this horrid den is not one of your model work-rooms?
    I was told that such things existed only in Russia!</p>

    <p>And are these people who are scowling at and cursing me your
    typical working population? Why, I was told that I should find
    them dear brothers, waiting to welcome us with open arms.</p>

    <p>And is this pittance you offer me all that you pay for
    making a coat? I was told that it was quite twelve times as
    much as this.</p>

    <p>Ah! I'm afraid I have been told, and have given credit to, a
    great many things to which I never should have listened at
    all.</p>

    <p>As you <i>will</i>, my Beauty! When did swaggering H-RC-RT's
    horticulture produce such goodly fruits? Or sour-mug'd
    M-RL-Y's? Or leary L-BBY's? Or Slawkenbergian M-ND-LLA's? Or
    even that of the Grand Old Grower, GL-DST-NE himself, with all
    his fluent patter about British Pomona, and the native
    Jam-pot?</p>

    <p>I know the badly-beaten lot maintain that the plant is a
    "Sport" from an old purchase of their own. Bless you, they
    claim <i>all</i> the good stocks&mdash;always did. Who cares?
    My young floricultural friend, JOE of Birmingham, who knows a
    bit about fruits as well as concerning orchids, let me tell
    you,&mdash;JOE, I say, laughs their preposterous pretensions to
    scorn. Look at G-SCH-N's own particular plant there&mdash;a bit
    late, but very promising, and probably destined to take a prize
    before the season's over. Didn't JOE recommend the stock to
    GL-DST-NE years ago? And didn't the haughty Hawarden
    horticulturist turn up his nose at it as an "Unauthorised"
    intruder upon his own Prize Programme? And, more by token,
    didn't JOE get the hump in consequence, cut the old connection,
    and set up on his own account in the forcing-house line, with a
    friendly leaning to our firm? Aha! "<i>Hinc illæ lachrymæ</i>,"
    as the Guv'nor would say. Hence, also, this Colossal
    Strawberry!</p>

    <p>Thanks of the Society? I should rayther think so! They may
    chaff "OLD MORALITY" as much as they like&mdash;but morality
    <i>pays</i>, even in strawberry-growing; and my duty to my
    (British) Queen has brought about <i>this</i> triumph. Early
    Industry started it, and careful horticultural Economy brought
    it to its present pitch of perfection. Look at it! Size, shape,
    sweetness, scent, all superb! If the Season shouldn't produce
    another Prize-Winner, this alone ought to satisfy SOLLY. And if
    G-SCH-N's seedling, "Gratis," <i>should</i> turn out a triumph
    later on, why we shall score tremendously. Wish G-SCH-N would
    "sit up and snort" less, and smile more. Patience and plenty of
    sun! That's the tip for a horticulturist. Standing at the door
    and shying stones at your neighbour's glasshouses, won't make
    your own fruit ripen, if GEORGE JOKIM could only see it. As
    H-RT D-KE says, <i>tu quoques</i> are a nuisance, and want
    fumigating off the face of the earth. JOKIM and ARTHUR B-LF-R a
    bit too fond of 'em for <i>my</i> fancy. However, all the
    "you're anothers" on earth can't affect my Strawberry now,
    thanks be! <i>The</i> Fruit of the Season, though I say it who
    perhaps shouldn't.</p>

    <h2>THE MODERN BRIGAND.</h2>

    <h4>(<i>Fragment from the Adventures of a Ransomed
    Prisoner.</i>)</h4>

    <p>I must confess I was agreeably surprised at the treatment to
    which I was subjected by my capturers. Instead of being loaded
    with chains and confined in a cell beneath the castle's moat, I
    was given perfect liberty, and had quite a pleasant suite of
    rooms. I should scarcely have known that I was in durance had
    not one of the less refined of the brigands shown me a
    revolver, and playfully informed me that its contents were
    intended for me if I attempted to escape. The Chief was
    absolutely charming. He treated me in the most courteous
    manner, and ended his first interview with me by requesting
    "the honour of my company at dinner."</p>

    <p>"You need not dress!" he observed, "although I like to put
    on a tail-coat myself. But I know that you have had some
    difficulty with my people about your luggage, and so I shall be
    only too delighted to excuse <i>grande tenue</i>."</p>

    <p>The "difficulty" to which my host referred was the seizing
    of my portmanteau by the gang of thieves of which he was the
    acknowledged head. I suggested that I might possibly recover
    some of its contents.</p>

    <p>"I am afraid not," returned the Chieftain. "You see my
    people are very methodical, and by this time I fear all the
    goods will have been sold. The motto of the Club is 'small
    profits and quick returns.' We find no difficulty in trading.
    As we carry on business on the most economical principles, we
    can quote prices even cheaper than the Stores."</p>

    <p>And this I found to be the case. Although the brigands were
    very civil to me, I was unable to trace any of my property.
    However, as my host in the kindest manner had allowed me to
    dispense with ceremony, I ventured to appear at dinner-time in
    my ordinary tourist's dress.</p>

    <p>"I am delighted to see you," said the Chief, speaking
    English for the first time, "as you are now my guest, I must
    confess that we are fellow countrymen."</p>

    <p>"Indeed!" I replied, considerably astonished. "If you are
    really of British nationality, how is it that I find you a
    professional thief?"</p>

    <p>"You are mistaken," returned the Chief. "I merely belong to
    a society for the redistribution of capital. You know we are
    all balloted for, and I was myself afraid that I might get
    pilled."</p>

    <p>"Indeed!" I exclaimed, in a tone of surprise. "Surely your
    accomplishments&mdash;for I noticed, on my arrival, that you
    were a first-rate hand at lawn tennis, and played the
    flute&mdash;would have secured your admission?"</p>

    <p>"Well," he returned with a smile, "I fancy they helped me
    with the Committee. But unhappily my antecedents were
    bad&mdash;I had made a fortune on the London Stock Exchange,
    and my books were scarcely as satisfactory as our bandit
    auditors could have desired them to be. However they took a
    kindly view of the case, and allowed me to pass through. But
    pardon me, I see your ransom has arrived. I am afraid I must
    say good bye. A pleasant journey."</p>

    <p>And shaking me warmly by the hand, he helped me into the
    conveyance that was to take me back to home and freedom. I have
    never seen him since.</p>

    <h2>A COY COLOSSUS.</h2>

    <p>PARIS, <i>June 15</i>.&mdash;It is stated here, on no
    authority whatever, that when the CZAR was recently visiting
    the French Exhibition at Moscow, his Imperial Majesty was heard
    to remark, "This makes me desire to see the Boulevards again."
    A visit of the ruler of Russia to Paris during the Summer is
    therefore considered to be certain. An offensive and defensive
    Alliance between the two countries is said to be on the point
    of signature.</p>

    <p>A few evenings ago, in a low <i>café</i> in Belleville, M.
    NOKASHIKOFF, who left St. Petersburg lately to escape his
    creditors, and who conceived the happy idea of raising a little
    money by walking to Paris in a sack composed of the French and
    Russian national flags stitched together, was entertained to
    supper by his Gallic admirers. The proceedings, especially
    towards midnight, were very enthusiastic. Throughout the
    festivities, constant cries of "<i>Vive l'Alliance
    Franco-Russe!</i>" were raised. This incident is said to have
    placed the immediate signature of the Treaty between the CZAR
    and President CARNOT beyond a doubt.</p>

    <p>Last evening a foreigner, who by appearance would have been
    taken for a Muscovite, was walking along the asphalte, when he
    was surrounded by a crowd of persons crying "<i>Vive la
    Russie!</i>" The foreigner seemed both surprised and annoyed by
    these attentions, and at length began to use his fists and his
    boots liberally on the ringleaders of the mob. This treatment,
    however, seemed only to increase their Russophil ardour, and
    the stranger was soon hoisted on to the shoulders of some of
    his foremost admirers, struggling violently. On the arrival of
    a gendarme, he explained that he was an English book-maker, and
    that "this bloomin' mob of boot-lickers had taken him for a
    bloomin' Russian!" The crowd shortly afterwards dispersed. The
    completion of the formal alliance between France and Russia is
    considered less certain than it was a few days ago.</p>

    <p>The Frenchman, M. TÊTE-BOIS, who recently attempted to walk
    on his head from Paris to Moscow, in order to show the sympathy
    felt in France for the Muscovite Empire, did not succeed in
    carrying out his design. He was stopped shortly after crossing
    the Russian frontier, imprisoned, and heavily ironed. After
    suffering in this way for a week, he was told that he must
    leave Russian territory within twenty-four hours, or else
    continue his journey to Siberia. On being appealed to, the CZAR
    graciously extended the time given for quitting Russia to
    forty-eight hours. This Imperial clemency has caused the widest
    feeling of gratitude and satisfaction in France, and the
    signature of the definitive Alliance between the two countries
    is confidently expected at an exceedingly early date.</p>

    <h2>ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.</h2>

    <h4>EXTRACTED FROM THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.</h4>

    <p><i>House of Commons, Monday Night, June 8</i>.&mdash;I knew
    DYKE first when (good many years ago now) as DIZZY's whip he
    hunted in couple with ROWLAND WINN; then always called HART
    DYKE. Like many other young men he has in interval lost his
    HART, and now known as Sir WILLIAM DYKE. Curious thing, as SARK
    reminds me, how absorbent is the name of WILLIAM. Quite
    probable that before <i>Black-Eyed Susan's</i> friend came
    prominently on the stage he had some other Christian name, sunk
    when he was promoted to shadow of yard-arm. Certainly there is
    an equally eminent man sitting opposite DYKE in House to-night,
    who like him is "Sir WILLIAM" to the present generation, and
    was VERNON HARCOURT to an elder one.</p>

    <p>DYKE, under whatever name, done excellently well to-night.
    Holding comparatively minor appointment in Ministry, suddenly
    finds himself in charge of principal measure of Session.
    Handicapped, moreover, with recollections of time when he has
    uncompromisingly declared himself against the very principle he
    now embodies in Bill, and invites House to add to Statute
    Book.</p>

    <p>That was first hedge for DYKE to take, and he went over in
    plucky style that threw the scorner off his trail. Didn't live
    in close communication with DIZZY through six long years for
    nothing. Not likely to forget what happened in very earliest
    days of Parliament of 1874, when DIZZY for first time found
    himself not only in office but in power. During election
    campaign DIZZY, speaking in the safety of Buckinghamshire, had
    made some wild statement about easing the chains of Ireland.
    Simply designed to gain Irish vote; forgotten as soon as
    spoken. But ROBERT MONTAGU&mdash;where, by the way, is ROBERT
    MONTAGU?&mdash;treasured these things up in his heart, and when
    DIZZY appeared in the House, Leader of triumphant majority,
    asked him what he was going to do about it?</p>

    <p>"It is sometime since the observations referred to were
    made," said DIZZY, "and&mdash;er&mdash;a good deal has happened
    in the interval."</p>

    <p>DYKE, recalling and admitting his former statements on Free
    Education, did not attempt to minimise their import. "But." he
    said, button-holing House as it were, and treating it quite
    confidentially, "the fact is we all change our minds." House
    laughed at this as it had laughed at DIZZY seventeen years ago,
    and DYKE, absolved and encouraged, went forward with his
    speech.</p>

    <p>Not a brilliant oration in any way; neither exordium nor
    peroration, and the middle occasionally a little mixed. But a
    good sensible straightforward speech, and if DYKE had done no
    more than show that an important Ministerial measure could be
    explained within limit of an hour, he would not have lived in
    vain.</p>

    <p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;Education Bill introduced.</p>

    <p><i>Tuesday</i>.&mdash;Nothing at first sight in personal
    appearance of HERBERT THOMAS KNATCHBULL-HUGESSEN that suggests
    a swan. Fancy I have heard something of these birds being
    addicted to the habit of breaking forth into song when
    convinced of approaching dissolution. That, I suppose, is how
    the swan was suggested to the mind when just now,
    KNATCHBULL-HUGESSEN rose from behind Ministers, and began to
    chant his threnody. Resolution on which Education Bill grafted
    brought up for report stage; agreed to, and HART DYKE about to
    bring in his Bill. Then from the back seat rose a sturdy yeoman
    figure, and a powerful voice was uplifted in denunciation of
    the Bill and of a Ministry that had betrayed the trust of the
    Conservative Party. It was, so the swan sang, a step on the
    road to Socialism. He feared it had come to pass that dangerous
    measures are more likely to emanate from the Treasury Bench
    than from the Front Bench opposite.</p>

    <p>Liberals roared with delighted laughter and cheers; the
    Conservatives sat glum and ill-at-ease. OLD MORALITY's white
    teeth gleamed with a spasmodic smile. As for JOKIM he folded
    his arms, and bit his lips and frowned.</p>

    <p>"What antiquated nonsense this is!" he muttered, "of course
    Free Education is not a Conservative principle. They all
    protested against it at the General Election. A year earlier I,
    who happened at the time to be numbered in the Liberal ranks,
    put my back <span class="pagenum"><a name="page300"
       id="page300"></a>[pg 300]</span> against the wall, and,
       picturing the evils that would befall my country if its
       institutions were thus demoralised, I said I would die
       before I would lend a hand to free the schools. But you see,
       TOBY, <i>I haven't died</i>, and that changes the whole
       situation. Not only enables me to retain my place in
       Government bringing in Free Education, but permits me, as
       CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER, actually to find the means for
       carrying out the system. Can't understand a fellow like this
       KNATCHBULL-HUGESSEN sticking to his principles when it
       becomes expedient to swallow them. He's a disgrace to a
       family that counts BRABOURNE as its head."</p>

    <div class="figleft"
         style="width:26%;">
        <a href="images/300-1.png"><img width="100%"
             src="images/300-1.png"
             alt="'A Progressive Conservative.' (&lt;i&gt;Vide Dod.&lt;/i&gt;)" />
        </a> "A Progressive Conservative." (<i>Vide Dod.</i>)
    </div>

    <p>"HUGESSEN's a good fellow," said ISAACSON; "wears well, but
    is politically a fossil. Now <i>I'm</i> a progressive
    Conservative, which I think you'll find, TOBY, my boy, to be
    about the time of day."</p>

    <p><i>Business done</i>.&mdash;Assisted Education Bill; firmly
    led up to table by HART DYKE.</p>

    <p><i>Wednesday</i>.&mdash;Lively fight round Deceased Wife's
    Sister Bill. Ascot in vain held forth its attractions;
    supporters of the Bill hoped opponents would go; opponents came
    down rather expecting HENEAGE's virtue would have given way,
    and Ascot would have claimed him as its own. But everybody
    there&mdash;MAKINS's men with long list of Amendments warranted
    to keep things going till half-past five, when progress must be
    reported, and chance of Bill for present Session lost. MAKINS
    himself in high oratorical feather. OSBORNE-AP-MORGAN, having
    made a proposition and subsequently withdrawn it, MAKINS,
    putting on severest judicial aspect, observed, "It is all very
    well for the Right Hon. and learned Gentleman to make a legal
    JONAH of himself and swallow his opinions."</p>

    <p>"Bless us all!" cried ROWNTREE, looking on with blank
    amazement, "MAKINS evidently thinks that JONAH swallowed the
    whale." Bill seemed to shatter friendships and dissever old
    alliances. SQUIRE of MALWOOD naturally at home in the fray, but
    rather startling to find HOME SECRETARY running amuck at
    CHAMBERLAIN. MATTHEWS in his most hoity-toity mood; quivered
    with indignation; thumped the table; shook a forensic
    forefinger at the undesignedly offending JOSEPH, and,
    generally, went on the rampage. As for HENEAGE, he filled up
    any little pause in uproar by diving in and moving the Closure.
    Once, whilst GEDGE was opposing an Amendment hostile to Bill,
    HENEAGE dashed in with his Closure motion. GEDGE's face a
    study; mingled surprise, indignation, and ineffable regret
    mantled his mobile front.</p>

    <div class="figright"
         style="width:28%;">
        <a href="images/300-2.png"><img width="100%"
             src="images/300-2.png"
             alt="'Bless us all!'" /></a>"Bless us all!"
    </div>

    <p>"To think," he said afterwards, "that just when I was coming
    to HENEAGE's help with an argument founded on profound study
    and pointed with legal lore, he should suddenly jump up, lower
    his head, and, as it were, butt me in the stomach with the
    Closure. It is more than I can at the moment comprehend."</p>

    <p>GEDGE so flurried that when Members returned, after Division
    on Closure, he being, in accordance with the rule, seated and
    wearing his hat, wanted to argue out the question with
    COURTNEY.</p>

    <p>"I submit, Sir," he said, "that the Hon. Member, in moving
    the Closure, controverted Rule 186."</p>

    <p>The Chairman: "I think the Hon. Member can scarcely have
    read the Rule."</p>

    <p>Mr. GEDGE: "I have read the Rule, Sir. This is what it
    says&mdash;"</p>

    <p>Chairman: "Order! Order!" and GEDGE subsided.</p>

    <p>Then TOMLINSON fortuitously turning up on Treasury Bench,
    joined in conversation. But COURTNEY turned upon him with such
    a thunderous cry of "Order! Order!" that TOMLINSON visibly
    shrivelled up, and his sentence, like the unfinished window in
    ALLADIN's Tower, unfinished must remain.</p>

    <p>Wrangling went on till a quarter past five, when TALBOT
    interposed, and with most funereal manner moved to report
    progress. HENEAGE almost mechanically lowered his head and had
    started to butt at TALBOT as he had upset GEDGE when he was
    providentially stopped and convinced that further struggle with
    obstruction was hopeless. So, Clause I. agreed to, Bill talked
    out. MAKINS, growing increasingly delightful, protested that a
    Bill that had been fifty years before the country, was not to
    be rushed through the House on a Wednesday afternoon.
    <i>Argal</i>, the more familiar the House is with the details
    of a measure, the more necessary is it to debate it.</p>

    <p><i>Business done</i>.&mdash;Marriage with a Deceased Wife's
    Sister. Banns again objected to.</p>

    <p><i>Saturday</i>, 1:25 A M.&mdash;Land Bill just through
    report stage. Nothing left now but Third Reading. "Well, KNOX,"
    said WINDBAG SEXTON, "that will be our last opportunity, and we
    must make the most of it. In meantime I think we've done pretty
    well. I'm especially pleased with you. You're a boy of great
    promise. If anything happened to me&mdash;a stray tack in the
    bench, or a pin maliciously directed, and the wind-bag were to
    collapse&mdash;you'd do capitally, till I got it repaired."</p>

    <p>WINDBAG JUNIOR blushed. As OLD MORALITY remarks, Ingenuous
    youth delights in the Approbation of Seasoned Seniority.</p>

    <p><i>Business done</i>.&mdash;Land at last&mdash;I mean Land
    Purchase Bill through at last.</p>

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1

     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
